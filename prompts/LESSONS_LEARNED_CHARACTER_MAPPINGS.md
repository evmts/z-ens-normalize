# Lessons Learned: Character Mappings Implementation

## The Critical Error

We initially implemented character mappings based on assumptions rather than checking the reference implementations. This led to:

1. **Wrong mappings**: We mapped ℌ → H instead of ℌ → h
2. **Incomplete solution**: We thought we needed recursive mapping (ℌ → H → h)
3. **Wasted time**: Debugging a problem that didn't exist in the references

## What the References Actually Do

After checking the JavaScript reference's spec.json:
```json
{
  "8460": [104]  // ℌ (8460) → h (104) - DIRECTLY TO LOWERCASE
}
```

ALL mathematical symbols map directly to their lowercase equivalents:
- ℂ (8450) → c (not C)
- ℌ (8460) → h (not H)
- ℕ (8469) → n (not N)
- ℙ (8473) → p (not P)
- ℤ (8484) → z (not Z)

## The Root Cause

1. We didn't check the actual data files first
2. We assumed how Unicode normalization "should" work
3. We created simplified test data instead of using reference data
4. We accepted "known limitations" instead of achieving 100% parity

## Correct Implementation Process

What we should have done from the start:

1. **Check the data first**:
   ```bash
   cat ens-normalize.js/derive/output/spec.json | jq '.mapped'
   ```

2. **Verify with multiple references**:
   - JavaScript spec.json
   - Rust implementation
   - Go implementation

3. **Copy the exact mappings**:
   - Don't simplify
   - Don't assume
   - Don't create our own

4. **Test with reference test cases**:
   - Use their test data
   - Expect identical results

## Key Technical Insights

1. **Character mappings are complete**: Each character maps directly to its final form
2. **No recursive mapping needed**: One-step transformations only
3. **Case folding is integrated**: Mathematical symbols include case normalization
4. **Data format matters**: The spec.json structure must be understood exactly

## Implementation Rules Going Forward

1. **NEVER** implement without checking references first
2. **ALWAYS** use the exact data from references
3. **NEVER** accept "known limitations" - achieve 100% parity
4. **ALWAYS** test with reference test cases

## The Cost of Assumptions

This mistake cost us:
- Time implementing wrong solution
- Time debugging non-existent problems
- Credibility by delivering incomplete solution
- Need to refactor already "completed" code

## Prevention Strategy

Before implementing ANY feature:
1. Read the reference data files
2. Read the reference implementation code
3. Run the reference tests
4. Understand WHY things work the way they do
5. Only then start implementing

Remember: A 90% solution is worse than no solution. Production parity is non-negotiable.
